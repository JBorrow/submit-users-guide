If you would like to monitor your condor job you can use the condor monitoring `CondorMon <http://submit04.mit.edu/condormon/index.html>`_, where you can see how many condor jobs are running, idle or held as well as where they are being submitted to. This site also gives an overview of your recent submissions.
