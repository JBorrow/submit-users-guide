User's guide -- subMIT login pool
---------------------------------

Welcome to the subMIT users guide! This will guide you on how to make an account to access the submit machines and how to create basic workflows for applications. Some simple examples will be provided including sample batch submission scripts for both Slurm and HTCondor. 

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subMIT login pool is designed to let users login safely prepare and tests their research computing tasks and submit them to the large computing resource of their choice. There are for now a limited number of resources connected but we are working on quickly expanding the available resources.

We have HTcondor connection to the Tier-2 computing cluster at Bates, the Tier-2 integration cluster (aka Tier-3) in building 24, the engaging cluster and the OSG. For CMS users the global CMS queue is also seemlesly integrated.


How to get an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make login convenient and secure we allow login to the subMIT pool using ssh keys only. Users of submit can go to our submit portal to upload their ssh key (or a number of keys). Upload of ssh keys is secured through MIT touchstone authentication. This means users need to have an MIT account.

It is straightforward to obtain an MIT guest account if you do not have one. A sponsor---usually a faculty you are working with---can request a guest account for you. The information needed for this sponsoring request is: first, last name and birthday. See the `sponsoring web page <https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts>`_. Please note: the process has to be started by the sponsor! The response by MIT IS&T has been very quick in the past, we have so far received all account requests in less than 4 hours.
